00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:40,032
Ever on and on I continue circling with nothing but my hate in a carousel of agony

2
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:46,989
Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing and suddenly I see that I can't break free

3
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:53,945
I'm slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity with nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony

4
00:00:53,946 --> 00:01:00,902
To tell me who I am, who I was, uncertainty enveloping my mind till I can't break free

5
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:03,945
And maybe it's a dream; maybe nothing else is real

6
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:06,989
But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel

7
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,945
So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside and I wish that I could live feeling nothing but the night
